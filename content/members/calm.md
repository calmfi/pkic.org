## Certificate Lifecycle Management

CALM is the provider of https://clm.fi which is a Certificate Lifecycle Management as a Service. Our offering provides tooling and automation for managing the lifecycle of PKI assets in organizations.

As by studies most of the expirations and revokings of certificates could be avoided by automation, we offer tooling for automating the process to take all necessary human interaction out of the process. This enables users to focus on more important tasks and avoid unmaintained certificates on everything from websites to IoT devices.
